Mix and match bundles are a great way to increase the AOV (average order value) of your Shopify store. They will help you sell more products, clear inventory faster, and also improve your conversion rate, but only if done right.

In this article, we will be going over how to create Mix and Match bundles on your Shopify store and start earning extra money from your customers for almost no additional cost.

Without further ado, let's get started!

# What are mix and match bundles?

There are different types of bundles that you can utilize on your Shopify store.

*   Volume bundles or multipacks - these are bundles where you give discounts if customers buy two or more of the same product  
    _Example:_ Buy two shirts, get 10% off, buy 3 get 20% off.
    
*   Frequently bought together bundles (FBT bundles)- with FBT bundles, you usually show certain products under the main product that the customer is looking at and offer a discount if they purchase these additional products along with the main product.  
    Example: laptop with bag and mouse offered as frequently bought together items
    
*   Pre-built bundles (boxes) - these bundles are pre-configured and packaged as a single product for you to buy with a discount already applied.  
    _Example:_ shampoo, lotion, and a deodorant packaged together as a Christmas gift.
    
*   **Mix and match bundles** \- mix and match bundles are very similar to pre-built bundles, but the key difference is that the products inside the bundle are not pre-selected by the merchant.  
    _Example:_ pick any lotion, deodorant, and shampoo and get 15% off on your custom bundle.
    

As you can see, all of these bundle types are different, and all of them have their purpose. In this tutorial, we will be strictly focusing on mix and match bundles and how to add them to your store.

# Who should and who shouldn't use mix and match bundles?

Mix and match bundles can be a great tool to increase your AOV and offer a unique shopping experience to your customers. They will feel like they are in control and that they have the ability to choose whichever products they like, instead of you making the choice for them.

Although that's all great, they may not be suited for every type of Shopify store out there. Some products are just hard to sell in bundles, especially mix and match bundles, and paying either for a developer or for an app simply doesn't make sense. On the other hand, there are brands whose products feel like they are made to be sold in bundles, and for them, it's a no-brainer.

## Products that sell better with mix and match bundles

*   Clothing products
    
*   Skincare products
    
*   Beauty products
    
*   Pre-made meals
    
*   Food
    
*   Gift boxes
    
*   Gift baskets
    

If you sell any of these types of products, mix and match bundles are for you. They will definitely help you increase your AOV and allow your customers to make their own bundles which will help them build a better connection to your brand.

## Products that sell worse mix and match bundles

*   Electronic products
    
*   Home appliances
    
*   Furniture
    
*   Any expensive products
    
*   Courses
    

It's not that these products can't be sold in mix and match bundles, but it usually doesn't make sense. Creating mix and match bundles on your store will cost you money, let's be honest about it. For it to make sense for you to pay extra either for the developer or for the app, you need to see the return higher than your money invested. With these kinds of products, that usually won't happen.

Most of these products are bought individually, and people rarely need multiple of them, which makes it very rare that they will be incited to buy multiple. Also, when people buy these products they aren't usually used to the headline "Build your own box (BYOB)" which is what most merchants use on their Shopify stores to incentivize customers to build their bundles.

# How to create mix and match bundles for your Shopify store?

Now the good parts, let's start creating mix and match bundles on your Shopify stores.

There are two ways you can create mix and match bundles on your store. Either by hiring a developer to build it for your store or by installing the app from the Shopify App Store that supports mix and match bundles.

Hiring a developer may make sense if your Shopify store is very specific and you can't find an off-the-shelf solution that solves your needs, but for most cases, installing an existing app will be both quicker and easier. Thus, I will use an app in this tutorial.

## Step 1 - Install the mix and match bundles app from Shopify App Store

We will start by installing the [NeatBundles Shopify app](https://apps.shopify.com/neat-bundles). This app will allow us to create mix and match bundles on our Shopify store. It has all the basic settings that you will need like configuring the number of steps, configuring discounts, changing colors, etc.

> _If by any chance you realize that you just need multipack bundles or pre-built bundles, you can install the_ [_Shopify bundles app_](https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-bundles) _for free and continue with that._

Just like with every other Shopify app, you need to click "Install", then click "Authorize".

## Select billing plan

After you've installed the app, you will be prompted to select a billing plan. All the plans are affordable, especially in this category and even the Basic plan, should be enough to get you started. If you are running a development store, like I am in this tutorial, you will be automatically assigned a free development plan.

## Connecting the app to your active theme

After selecting the billing plan, you will be redirected to an installation page, where you'll need to enable the app on your active theme. NeatBundles app requires this to be able to show a mix and match bundles builder on your store.
